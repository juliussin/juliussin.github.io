## Water Heating Automation System for Swimming Pool
> Caption

<img src="/images/pool.jpg" alt="HMI">

This is my first professional project when I was doing an internship. 
The main goal is to **automate** the water heating system in the swimming pool and integrate **temperature control** into the existing system.
Temperature input can be done either via **interactive touch screen** (HMI) or **Android application** connected to the **programmable logic controller**.
This system can also **control and monitor** the state of water pumps and heaters as shown in the HMI display.
Multiple PLCs and HMIs are connected using **wireless communication**.

#### Objective

> Creating prototype of six legged robot that could walk and be controlled based on Internet of Things.

#### Details

* Utilizing ESP8266 to control numerous servomotors
* Control the robot over internet with mobile based application
* Equipped with navigation sensor (magnetometer) for directional detection feature 
(When the robot is physically deflected it can return to its original direction)

#### Keywords

IoT, mobile application, robot, microcontroller, sensor & actuator

## DIY Smart IR Remote Connected to Home Automation

> Caption

Replacing conventional remote, this tool can **control air conditioners and televisions** through **home automation system**. 
An infrared LED is controlled by the **ESP8266** working as a remote, which can be set with **HTTP REST API** or **home assistant** like Google Home.
This device can act as a **web server** or be connected to a **database** like Firebase Realtime Database.
For air conditioner, controls include temperature setting, on/off, mode, etc.
