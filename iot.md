## DIY Smart IR Remote Connected to Home Automation

> Caption

Replacing conventional remote, this tool can **control air conditioners and televisions** through **home automation system**. 
An infrared LED is controlled by the **ESP8266** working as a remote, which can be set with **HTTP REST API** or **home assistant** like Google Home.
This device can act as a **web server** or be connected to a **database** like Firebase Realtime Database.
For air conditioner, controls include temperature setting, on/off, mode, etc.
