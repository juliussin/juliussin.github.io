This is my first professional project when I was doing an internship. 
The main goal is to **automate** the water heating system in the swimming pool and integrate **temperature control** into the existing system.
Temperature input can be done either via **interactive touch screen** (HMI) or **Android application** connected to the **programmable logic controller**.
This system can also **control and monitor** the state of water pumps and heaters as shown in the HMI display.
Multiple PLCs and HMIs are connected using **wireless communication**.

Utilizing **ESP8266** to control numerous **servomotors**, this project is an example of **Internet of Things**.
This robot can be **controlled over internet** with **mobile based application**.
In addition, this robot is equipped with a directional detection feature using a **magnetometer**, 
so that when the robot is physically deflected it can return to its original direction.
